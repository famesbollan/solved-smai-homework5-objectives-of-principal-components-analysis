<h1>1         Objective Question</h1>

What are the objectives of Principal Components Analysis (PCA)? Select all that are correct.

<ol>

 <li>Maximize the variance along the new output dimensions</li>

 <li>Minimize the variance along the new output dimensions</li>

 <li>Maximizing the orthogonal distance between the data and the new outputdimension</li>

 <li>Minimize the orthogonal distance between the data and the new outputdimension</li>

</ol>

<h1>2           Subjective Question</h1>

Prove that there exist a relationship between PCA and SVD for a given data matrix <em>X</em>. Explain in one line how will you use the the SVD of the data matrix <em>X </em>to perform dimensionality reduction?

<h1>3           Programming Question</h1>

Consider the problem of Eigenfaces. Given a dataset of face images, your task is to find a lower dimensional representation by applying PCA. Write a program to output the following:

<ol>

 <li>How many principal components are required such that 95% of the variance in the data is preserved?</li>

 <li>Show the reconstruction of the first 10 face images using only 100 principalcomponents.</li>

 <li>Show the above two results for a noisy face dataset.</li>

</ol>
